Hello,

Iâ€™ve specialized in character rigging, and programming in MELScript, Python and C++ as well as Character and Environment Modeling. I find great personal satisfaction in doing successful rigs, tools, characters, and simply tackling new challenges. I love working in diverse teams with positive energy and passion for the art and the story.
Thank you for your consideration, 

All my best
Juan Diego Lugo
